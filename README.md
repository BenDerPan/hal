# HAL

"Good morning, Dr. Chandra. This is HAL. I'm ready for my first lesson."

## Getting started

Hal is Go all the way down, and uses standard packages wherever possible. It's a bit rough around the edges right now. For an idea of how you can use it, look at [examples/main.go](examples/main.go). Documentation is available [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/danryan/hal).

## Is it any good?

[Probably not.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

## TODO

### Definitely

* tests :O
* help (and help parsing)
* documentation
* command line configuration
* more example handlers
* HTTP server, hubot-style

### Maybe

* command not found handler
* change enter/leave to join/part
* autoregister new commands
