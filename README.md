HAL
=====

"Good morning, Dr. Chandra. This is HAL. I'm ready for my first lesson."

Getting started
---------------

Hal is Go all the way down, and only uses standard packages. It's a bit rough around the edges right now. For an idea of how you can use it, look at [examples/main.go](examples/main.go). 

Is it any good?
---------------

[Probably not.](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

TODO
----

Definitely
~~~~~~~~~~

* documentation
* command line configuration
* more example handlers
* HTTP server, hubot-style

Maybe
~~~~~

* command not found handler
* change enter/leave to join/part
* autoregister new commands
